## Project Proposal

**Project Description:**
Our project aims to leverage California state test data to create an interactive and informative data visualization application. We will collect and store California state test data in a database, develop a Python Flask API as the backend, and build a frontend interface using HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and a JavaScript library not covered in our coursework. The primary goal is to provide users with valuable insights into California's education system through intuitive visualizations and user-driven interactions.

**Data Components and Database:**
1. **Data Source**: We will obtain California state test data from publicly available datasets provided by the California Department of Education, ensuring that we have a substantial dataset with over 100 unique records.

2. **Database**: We will use an SQLite database to store and manage the test data efficiently.

**Backend Development:**
1. **Python Flask API**: Our project will be powered by a Python Flask API that will serve as the backend. It will handle data retrieval, processing, and communication with the frontend.

**Frontend Development:**
1. **Interactive Visualizations**: We will use D3.js, a JavaScript library not covered in our course, to create interactive data visualizations. These visualizations will include charts and graphs to display key insights from the test data.

2. **User-Driven Interactions**: The frontend will feature multiple user-driven interactions, such as dropdowns for selecting specific test categories, filters for refining data by district or year, and zoom features to focus on specific data points.

3. **Dashboard Design**: Our frontend will follow a dashboard design, presenting users with a unified interface that hosts multiple charts and visualizations, all referencing the same California state test data.

**Visualizations:**
1. **Three Unique Views**: We will create at least three unique views of the data, including trend analysis, performance by district, and subject-specific insights.

2. **User-Friendly Presentation**: Visualizations will be designed to present data in a clear, digestible manner, making it easy for users of all levels to interpret and understand the education trends in California.

**Group Presentation:**
1. **Speaker Rotation**: During our group presentation, all team members will take turns speaking to ensure equal participation and knowledge sharing.

2. **Relevance**: Our presentation will focus on the project's objectives, data sources, methodologies, and the significance of the visualizations in understanding California state test data.

3. **Engagement**: We will maintain audience interest through engaging visuals, real-world insights, and interactive demonstrations of our data visualization application.

4. **Smooth Flow**: Content, transitions, and conclusions in our presentation will flow smoothly within any time restrictions to ensure a coherent and effective presentation.

**Timeline:**
- Week 1-2: Data collection and database setup
- Week 3-4: Backend development (Python Flask API)
- Week 5-6: Frontend development (D3.js visualizations)
- Week 7-8: User-driven interactions and dashboard design
- Week 9-10: Testing, refinement, and preparation for presentation

**Grading Expectations:**
We aim to achieve an A grade for this project by meeting or exceeding all the project requirements and criteria outlined in the project description.

**Conclusion:**
Our California State Test Data Visualization project will provide valuable insights into California's education system by utilizing state test data in an interactive and user-friendly manner. We are excited to embark on this project and look forward to presenting our findings and visualizations to the class.
